### Just a retired website I made in my free time with the goal of making $$$

Created with bootstrap framework paired with a CPI (Cost per Install) affiliate network specializing in mobile content lockers(OGads)

Looking at this from an investment standpoint, this venture was successful. I spent only $20 for a year's domain and hosting and earned several hundred dollars. The only thing that held me back from continuing this was the upfront (non-promotional) hosting/domain renewal price.

A few notes:

* Clash Royale is a popular game and my targeted keywords were competitive which is why I only ended up on maybe the 5th page (at best) of Google, which is basically useless as most people don't even go past the 1st page.

* Peak unique daily users was around 700 with the average being 500 (Thank you Google Analytics/Webmaster)

* The SEO done was metatag optimization and linking the website with specific anchor text on high DA/PR (domain authority/page rank) websites. I used my own people.ucsc.edu page with hopes that Google would pick up on that backlink but they never did..in fact most backlinks never picked up on.

* There was a random surge in traffic that led to the average 500 daily users. 95% of the traffic came from a Mexican website and to this day, I have no idea why. Any traffic is good traffic but North American traffic is always king when it comes to affiliate networks as the offer payouts are 10x higher than its South American counterpart.

Although this was not my first website like this, it was second one that received significant traffic and earnings. My first website was geared towards Microsoft points, a virtual currency used on the popular Xbox. That one ran for about 4 years and made a lot more money. I was able to rank 1st on Google for the keyword "free microsoft points" and boy...I was raking in the dough.

Website design doesn't seem to matter too much when it comes to this stuff as much as just having a landing page for your content locker paired with a good Google ranking. My Microsoft points website was just a simple blog post with a bunch of #FF0000 and bold tags which looks like trash compared to my sleek Clash Royale website.

Overall, fun project. Check it out in action :
